# Informed vs Uninformed search comparison


The program illustrates the difference between Informed(A*) and Uninformed(Dijkstra) search algorithms. 

A graph model is built upon the data which is taken from p1_graph.txt file in the format described in it. The source and destination vertices are also taken from there.

The search is then executed with both of the algorithms, and details are shown on the console.

## How to use

Run the main method in Main.class inside app package. A file with the "p1_graph.txt" name must be located in the project root folder. It contains Source and Destination variables that can be modified.
